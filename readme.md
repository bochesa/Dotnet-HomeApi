# Practice and refresh

I have used this project to refresh my dotnet knowledge, and practice my coding skills in vs code instead of visual studio.

I have made this into a private api and backend for my own website. The idea is to use it for personal use, my first attempt at this is a deposit/withdrawel of a budget for my job. I'll use it to keep my self posted on my work budget on the go.
